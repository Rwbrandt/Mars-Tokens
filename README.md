## Outline

This group of three smart contracts serves the purpose of creating a crypto currency crowdfunding campaign.  The three contracts created and compiled are for the creation of the crowdfund, the crowdfund transactions as well as the coin itself.  Screenshots below and in the Evaluation_Evidence folder show the contracts in action and the creation of the coins.
